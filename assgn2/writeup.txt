1. Team Information:
   - Name: Rudy Garcilazo
   - Course ID: CS4318 5331

2. Meeting Schedule:
   Since I am working alone, I plan to dedicate daily time slots to work on the project. I will work on the project every day for several hours to ensure timely completion within the one-week timeline.

3. Detailed Parser Implementation Plan:
   
   - Day 1: Review Grammar Rules
     I will review the grammar rules and define necessary tokens, operators, and constructs for the parser. This will include setting up the lexer and identifying key structures in the grammar.

   - Day 2: Define Parser Structure
     I will create the structure of the parser, setting up the yacc file and defining `%union` to handle different types of parse tree nodes. I will also plan the general workflow of the parser.

   - Day 3: Implement Basic Parsing Rules
     I will implement the parsing rules for basic expressions (arithmetic, assignments). This will ensure the parser can correctly handle variable assignments and basic operations.

   - Day 4: Implement Complex Parsing Logic
     I will implement parsing logic for control flow structures such as if-else statements and loops. Special attention will be given to ensure proper scope and control handling.

   - Day 5: Handle Functions and Declarations
     I will add support for function declarations, function calls, and return statements. This will involve setting up argument parsing and managing return types.

   - Day 6: Error Handling and Testing
     I will focus on adding error handling for the parser. This includes clear syntax error messages and robust handling of invalid inputs. I will also create test cases to verify the correctness of the parser.

   - Day 7: Finalization and Documentation
     I will finalize the parser, clean up the code, and ensure all test cases pass. I will also write detailed documentation on the implementation and structure of the parser.
